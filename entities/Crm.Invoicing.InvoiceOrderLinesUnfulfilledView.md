# Crm.Invoicing.InvoiceOrderLinesUnfulfilledView View

**Namespace:** [Crm.Invoicing](Crm.Invoicing.md)  

Returns the uninvoiced (unfulfilled) Invoice Order Lines from Invoice Orders, which are Released. Is_Fulfilled and Is_QuantityFulfilled can be used to filter out lines which appear fulfilled. For best performance, the invoice orders should be finished after fulfilling. Entity: Crm_Invoice_Order_Lines_Unfulfilled_View (Introduced in version 24.1.5.17)
