<h2 id="what-is-a-system-business-rule">What is a System Business Rule?</h2>
<p>The System Business Rules specify a specific action that the system must take to verify and/or modify data that is entered into the database.</p>
<p>Аccording to their аction, there are two main types of business rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rules that validate the data that has been entered</strong> - e.g. if a particular field has a value, if the value is valid, if the value interferes with the values of the other fields, settings, or business logics.</li>
<li><strong>rules that modify something</strong> - e.g. sets a value in a particular field, triggers an event for another entity, and others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Each System Business Rule whose code is with the format 'R' + 'digit number', e.g. R27179, has a documentation topic.</p>
<p>The topic is available in the Business Rules section of the Model Documentation for the particular Entity e.g. Sales Orders's <a href="https://docs.erp.net/model/entities/Crm.Sales.SalesOrders.html#business-rules">Business Rules</a>.</p>
<p>Every topic includes a standardized table that contains detailed information about the rule. The standardized table allows us to organize data in a structured way and helps the reader to navigate through the info quickly.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Column Name</th>
<th>Column Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Code</td>
<td>Unique System Business Rule code. Always starts with &quot;R&quot; and continues with a digit number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Entity</td>
<td>The entity for which the Action of the System Business Rule is executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>The name of the System Business Rule. The name is unique per entity.<br> Usually, the name is simply the name of the attribute for which the rule is created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attribute</td>
<td>This is the attribute (field) of the entity object to which the rule applies. There may be rules that do not apply to any particular field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Layer</td>
<td>The layer where the System Business Rule is executed. Possible values are: <br>- Front-End - the rule is executed on the client-side of the application i.e. in the user interface while the data is being modified by the user. <br> - Back-End - the rule is executed on the server side of the application, regardless of whether the information is entered through a user interface or through the API</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Events</td>
<td>The events that will trigger the execution of the rule. Possible events are: <br>- Commit - occurs when the data is saved into the database. <br>- Planning + - occurs during the document state change to 'Planned' or higher. (applies only to documents)<br>- Planned + - occurs after the document state change to 'Planned' or higher. It occurs after all other validations on Planning + (applies only to documents)<br>- FirmPlanning + - occurs during the document state change to 'FirmPlanned' or higher. (applies only to documents)<br>- FirmPlanned + - occurs after the document state changes to 'FirmPlanned' or higher. It occurs after all other validations on FirmPlanning + (applies only to documents)<br> - Releasing + - occurs during the document state change to 'Released' or higher. (applies only to documents)<br> - Released + - occurs after the document state changes to 'Released' or higher. It occurs after all other validations on Releasing + (applies only to documents)<br>- Completing + - occurs during the document state change to 'Completed' or higher. (applies only to documents)<br> - Compleated + - occurs after the document state changes to 'Completed' or higher. It occurs after all other validations on Completing + (applies only to documents)<br>- Closed - occurs when the document state is changed to 'Closed'. (applies only to documents)<br>- Voiding - occurs when a document is being voided. (applies only to documents)<br>- ClientCommit - occurs when the data is saved into the database, nut only when the saving is initiated by a client application. If the object is modified by the EnterpriseOne server, then this event is not triggered EnterpriseOne Server.<br>- AttributeChanged (TheAttribute) - occurs when an attribute/field value is changed. The attribute/s whose value is being changed is/are specified in the brackets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Priority</td>
<td>Possible values are Early, Normal, or Late. <br> The priority is taken into account in the execution order. The rules with an Early priority are executed first, followed by those with Normal priority, and rules with a Late priority are executed last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Modify</td>
<td>Shows explicitly whether the rule modifies the entity's data. Possible values are YES and NO. <br> If the rule only checks if a particular field is filled in or not, then Modify = NO. But if the rule checks if a particular field is filled in and if it is not - sets a value in it, then Modify = YES.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Applicable Legislations</td>
<td>Specifies whether the rule has to be executed according to the particular party's applicable legislation. Possible values are:<br> - 'ALL // no condition needed' - There is no condition and the rule will be executed regardless of the legislation of the related parties.<br>- The legislation abbreviation (the conditional Party) e.g. BG (EnterpriseCompany.Company) - The rule will be executed only if in the Applicable Legislations child table of the particular Party there is a record with the specified Legislation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Action</td>
<td>Technical description of the conditions and the operation of the rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Text description of the rule - conditions, operation, the business logic behind it, related topics, and oth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Message</td>
<td>The message that is shown in the client application if the conditions of the business rule are not met. Applicable only for validation rules. <br><br> May contain additional information about <em>&quot;Sort Messages By Attribute:&quot;</em> - Тhe attribute by whose value the message appearance is ordered - if the message is repeated more than once. <br>If we are editing a document, for example, and the message has to be thrown for a couple of its lines, then it will probably be far easier for the user to follow them if they are sorted by the &quot;Line Number&quot; of the document lines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Version</td>
<td>A list with all versions in which the Business Rule has been somehow changed. Usually contains two types of records: <br>- 'Introduced: 2xxx.x' - the version since which the Business Rule type is available;<br>- 'Updated: 2xxx.x' - the version in which the Business Rule has been changed plus a short description of the changes. There could be non or multiple records of this type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Revocable</td>
<td>Shows whether the rule can be revoked for a particular database or not. In order to be revoked - the rule's code has to be specified in the list of the registry key 'RevokedBusinessRules'. (for more information, see key number 41 in the todo:(Config Options Reference topic))</td>
